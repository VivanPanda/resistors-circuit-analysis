# Resistors Circuit Analysis

The aim of this project was to familiarse myself with the analogRead command using the Arduino interface. I connected two resistors in series (a 330 Ohm, and a 10,000 Ohm resistor) and carried out circuit analysis to work out the respective voltages of the resistors using Ohm's law. I then built the circuit using an Arduino and a breadboard by following my schematic and confirmed the individual voltages of the resistors using jumper wires.
